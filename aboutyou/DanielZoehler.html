            <p>Daniel Zoehler has very simple interests. The one that stands out most of all is his interest in math. 
                His ultimate career goal is to become a  mathematician. In order to accomplish such a thing, he reads 
                and takes part in computer programming, which he finds fun. Meanwhile, Zoehler leads a life with an extensive family. 
                He has two sisters, two step-sisters, and two brothers, making a large family of nine once Daniel, his mom, and his step-dad are included. 
                Daniel also loves both wolves and snakes. And even further than that, his favorite colors are red and black.</p>
