                    <p>Quidditch is a fast, dangerous, exciting game in which two teams flying on brooms compete for points scored by throwing a ball – the Quaffle – through hoops on either end of a large grassy pitch.</p>
                    <p> There are three goal posts at either ends of a field. That field is called a Quidditch pitch. There are seven players on each side: the Keeper, the Seeker, three Chasers and two Beaters. One player is also appointed as the Captain. Professional teams will also have a manager.</p>

                    <p>The Slytherin Quidditch team is the Quidditch team for the Hogwarts Slytherin house. Each year, they compete for the Inter-House Quidditch Cup, an award presented to the Hogwarts House team that earns the most points. Unlike the Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw teams, the Slytherin team has no qualms with cheating and unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>
                    <p>It has been noted that the Slytherin team employs players of brute strength, rather then skill. An example of this is Gregory Goyle, who was given the position of Beater in his fifth year. The Slytherin team's cheers are usually very insulting, like that of Weasley is Our King.</p>
