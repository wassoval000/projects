            <h3>The Start of the Digital Goats</h3>
            <article>
                <p>You know how early a robotics team started based off of how small or large its number is.</p>
                <p>Numbers for teams that I have seen go up into the six thousands.</p>
                <p>This makes team 829 one of the earliest teams to start robotics. The name "Digital Goats" was allegedly meant to be "Digital Golds" based off of Warren's colors of black and gold.</p>
                <p>The name was misheard and read off as "Digital Goats" and the name has stuck ever since.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the name is regularly misspelled as "Digtal Goats" on game shirts as it is seen as good luck.</p>
